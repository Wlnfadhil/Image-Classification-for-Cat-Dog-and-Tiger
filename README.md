# README for Submission Project

## Overview
This project contains various models and resources for machine learning applications, specifically focusing on TensorFlow.js, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow SavedModel formats. 

## Directory Structure
- **tfjs_model/**: Contains files related to the TensorFlow.js model.
  - `group1-shard1of1.bin`: Binary weights for the TensorFlow.js model.
  - `model.json`: Defines the architecture of the TensorFlow.js model and links to the binary weights.

- **tflite/**: Contains files related to the TensorFlow Lite model.
  - `model.tflite`: The TensorFlow Lite model optimized for mobile and edge devices.
  - `label.txt`: Labels corresponding to the classes predicted by the TensorFlow Lite model.

- **saved_model/**: Contains files related to the TensorFlow SavedModel.
  - `saved_model.pb`: Serialized TensorFlow model including the computation graph and metadata.
  - `variables/`: Directory containing the variables of the TensorFlow model, including weights and biases.

- **notebook.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook for code, visualizations, and documentation for working with the models.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
